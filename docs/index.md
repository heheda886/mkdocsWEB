# ABFML

**ABFML** (A problem-oriented package for rapidly creating, screening, and optimizing new machine learning force fields)  
is a Python-based toolkit designed to streamline the development, training, and deployment of machine learning force fields (MLFFs).  
It integrates modern deep learning frameworks and molecular dynamics engines, enabling efficient model construction and application.

---

## Features
- Rapid construction of MLFF models based on physical descriptors
- Support for large-scale molecular dynamics via **LAMMPS** and **ASE**
- Modular design for easy extension and research customization

---

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install abfml
